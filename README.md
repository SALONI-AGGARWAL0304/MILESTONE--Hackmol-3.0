Description of Idea
IDea : To organise , sponsor and attend an event
Problem : A platform for enents is must
As sponsors are required for every type of event in college but it's a very tough task to find sponsors just in return of their logo pasted on our website . A platform is required where all college events must be well maintained . so, We have put a small effort to find sponsors and it is easy for sponsors to check every detail of event , sometimes sponsors also need publicity so this website will keep them updated with upcoming events also . In Future, This platform provides student an ease to join and attend all events of their choice . College will get popularity and events will be organized on large scale with more bright minds. The project may be extended for other colleges too.
